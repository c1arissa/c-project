# c++ project

## Master branch (aka "production" branch) contains the original source code files.

Please make all changes in the development branch.  We will merge the development branch into the Master when the new code is complete!

### Get started:

To work on files locally:

`git clone https://github.com/c1arissa/c-project.git`

`cd c-project`

Change working branch on your local machine to development:

`git checkout development`

To list all branches and check your current working branch:

`git branch`

Pull frequently to update your local repository to the newest commit:

`git pull origin development`

Check the status of the current branch:

`git status`

### Basic Workflow:

To add new files or changes:

`git add .`

To commit with message:

`git commit -m "Commit message"`

To send those changes from your local machine to your remote repository:

`git push origin development`
