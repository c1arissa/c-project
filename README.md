## Dev Branch

Use this branch to modify source code files!

### Get started:

To work on files locally:

`git clone https://github.com/c1arissa/c-project.git`

`cd c-project`

Change working branch on your local machine to development:

`git checkout development`

To list all branches and check your current working branch:

`git branch`

Pull frequently to update your local repository to the newest commit:

`git pull origin development`

Check the status of the current branch:

`git status`

### Basic Workflow:

To add new files or changes:

`git add .`

To commit with message:

`git commit -m "Commit message"`

To send those changes from your local machine to your remote repository:

`git push origin development`
